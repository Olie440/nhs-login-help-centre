If you write the numbers down, make sure they are clear and the paper is not held in front of your face. Camera does not work when recording a video If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when recording a video, this may be a problem with permissions. You should make sure the web browser on your device has camera and microphone permissions. You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone. iOS devices If you have an iOS device, updating the iOS operating system software on your device to a newer version may also help, if available. Version 11.2 iOS will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera. There is an Apple support article that describes how to check for updates. Android devices If you have an Android device, you should avoid the ‘camera’ option when given a choice of applications to record the video with. You should choose a video option instead, like ‘camcorder’ or ‘capture video’. How to give your web browser permission to access the camera and microphone How to give our website permission to access the camera and microphone Unable to replay or upload your video If you cannot replay your video, this could be because the video format captured by your device camera is not supported by your browser.

For example: video/mp4 video/webm If this does not work, you can also try recording a video on another device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member. What to do if your video file is damaged We run a virus check on your video file before it is verified. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one.
